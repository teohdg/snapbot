# snapbot
selenium script that automatically sends snap streaks using snapchat.com/web and snapchat shorcuts.
made for digital minimalist who still have friends from high school ðŸ’”

** INFO **
this script is written with brave browser in mind.
i plan on rewriting the script for google chrome in the future

** HOW TO USE **
1. create a new profile on your browser
2. find that profile's path `(    options.add_argument(r"--user-data-dir=C:\Users\teohd\AppData\Local\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\User Data")
    options.add_argument(r"--profile-directory=Profile 2")`
3. create a snap shortcut with your streaks (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaFe7vJiraA)
4. run snapbot with chromedriver.exe in the same folder
5. use windows task scheduler or something similar to run autonomously
